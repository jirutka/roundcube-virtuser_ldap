= virtuser_ldap

This plugin is very similar to built-in https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/tree/master/plugins/virtuser_query[virtuser_query], but it uses LDAP instead of SQL database.

The main goal of this plugin is to allow users to log in using username or full mail address.

== Installation

Clone this repository into Roundcube’s plugins directory as `virtuser_ldap`.
Then copy `config.inc.php.dist` to `config.inc.php` and edit it.
